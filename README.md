# **Project Nautilus**

## **Project Overview**
This is a **pilot project** for a social network application built using the **MERN stack** (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) integrated with **Prisma ORM** for database management.  
The main goal of this project is to experiment with building a modern, scalable, and efficient social network system that can later be expanded into a full application.

## **Tech Stack**
- **MongoDB** – NoSQL database for storing users, posts, comments, and relationships.  
- **Express.js** – Backend framework for handling API routes and middleware.  
- **React.js** – Frontend framework for building an interactive user interface.  
- **Node.js** – Runtime environment for the backend.  
- **Prisma ORM** – Database toolkit to simplify queries, migrations, and schema management.
